Ayy, thanks for catching the crows, ayy!
Heres the car parts that you wanted, ayy!
+[Thanks, what will you do with these crows though?]
    What do you mean "What am I going to do with these crows?", I am going to cook them.
    ++[I'm sorry what?]
        Yeah! I am going to feed them to my family during Christmas Eve AND Christmas. Free food!!
            +++[I hope this doesn't start another pandemic... After the one in 2020...]
            A pandemic in 2020? What do you mean? Let's see... Fried crow? Steamed crow? Yum Yum!
