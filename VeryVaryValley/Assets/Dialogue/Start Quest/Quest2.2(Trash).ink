You've got the gun? Thats great!
+[Yep, but how do I use it...]
    Oh its easy to use actually. You just hold the gun in your hand, point at the trash in the pond, then just click on the trash. easy!
    ++[Got you, I'll do just that!]
    Nice! Once done, make sure to talk to me to know what to do next!
