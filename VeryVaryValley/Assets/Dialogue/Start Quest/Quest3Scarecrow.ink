My poor crops...
    +[Is something wrong here?]
    Hi travellor, I have been quite unlucky with my crops being destroyed by those pesky crows...
        ++[That is quite unlucky, is there anything I could help with?]
        I think you can help... Maybe you can help me make some a scarecrow by gathering parts from around the valley? 
            +++[Yeah, I can do that.]
            Oh thank you, and I heard that you were looking for car parts to fix your broken car? Maybe I can trade you something for completing this quest.
                ++++[Sounds fantastic!]
                Great! Make sure to talk to me after you're done! Good luck!
